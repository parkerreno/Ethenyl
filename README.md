# ProjectEthenyl
##What is ProjectEthenyl?
Ethenyl is a new take on the jukebox - it connects with Spotify on your computer and allows friends and family to queue up music.  Eventually I'd like to add a points system and expand it to be more cross-platform, but for now it will be a Windows/ UWP application.

##The Projects
- SoftServe: The WPF server app that interfaces with Spotify
- WaferCone: The client app that is used to control SoftServe, can connect via sockets or internet + HTTP (both WIP)

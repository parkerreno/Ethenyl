  "body": "### Welcome to Project Ethenyl.\r\nEthenyl is a new take on the jukebox - it connects with Spotify on your computer and allows friends and family to queue up music. Eventually I'd like to add a points system and other more interesting functionality, so keep up with changes!\r\n\r\n### Device Compatibility\r\nFor now, SoftServe (the desktop/server/music player) can only run on Windows (8+).  WaferCone (the control app) is being developed for multiple operating systems with a focus on Windows and Android to start (because I don't have a mac).",
